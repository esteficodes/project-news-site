        <title>Latin Artist on the Rise: Meet Cazzu, The Queen of Argentine Trap</title>
        <p>Argentine artist Cazzu was put on our radar after she was spotted sharing the stage with Bad Bunny in concert and also for her fiery verse on Dalex’s “Pa Mi (Remix).”

          Despite this being her first official year making waves in the Latin music industry, Cazzu (real name: Julieta Cazzucheli) has been an underground gem for nearly 10 years. “I tried out many genres,” she says to Billboard of her start in music. “It’s a long road but I can happily tell you that I was able to take advantage of every experience and everything that came out bad.” 
          
          Cazzu’s passion for music goes back to her roots. “My dad plays the guitar and sings. 
          He’s the first image I have when it comes to music,” she says, admitting that everything she knows today is because of him.
           “I never studied music or took singing lessons. Music was greatly appreciated in my house and we consumed all types of music.” </p>
